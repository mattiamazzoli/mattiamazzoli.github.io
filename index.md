title: About me
---



I am Mattia Mazzoli, currently I am a PostDoctoral Researcher at ISI Foundation in Turin, Italy.

My work involves the use of digital surveillance systems for Influenza&Covid-like-illness and the role played by different sources of mobility data on epidemic spreading at different spatial scales. 

Relying on my expertise on human mobility, I mainly worked with spatial transmission models to describe the spatio-temporal invasion of infectious diseases on the territory at different spatial scales.

My main areas of interests are post-pandemic cities, spatial transmission models, migration studies, health care accessibility and socio-economic segregation analyses.
