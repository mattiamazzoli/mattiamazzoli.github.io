title: About me
---



I am Mattia Mazzoli, currently I am a PostDoctoral Researcher at ISI Foundation in Turin, Italy.

I work with digital surveillance systems for Influenza and Covid-19 and human mobility data integrated epidemic models.

Relying on my expertise on human mobility, I mainly worked with spatial transmission models to describe the spatio-temporal invasion of infectious diseases on the territory at different spatial scales.

My main areas of interests are pandemic preparedness, post-pandemic cities, computational epidemiology, migration studies, health care accessibility and socio-economic segregation.
