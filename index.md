**##About me##**


I am Mattia Mazzoli, currently I am a PostDoctoral Researcher at the Pierre Louis Institute of Epidemiology and Public Health (IPLESP) of the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM), and Sorbonne Universit√©, in Paris, France.

My work involves the analysis of different sources of mobility traces and their dynamic connection with epidemic records at different spatial scales. I mainly work with spatial transmission models to describe the spatio-temporal invasion of infectious diseases on the territory at different spatial scales.
