title: About me
---



I am Mattia Mazzoli, currently I am a PostDoctoral Researcher at ISI Foundation in Turin, Italy.
I work with digital surveillance systems for Influenza and Covid-19 and human mobility data integrated epidemic models.

I achieved my PhD in Physics of Complex Systems at IFISC in Palma, Spain, with a thesis on human mobility modeling and applications on epidemic spread, urban structure and migration patterns.

Relying on my expertise on human mobility, I have worked at the EPIcx Lab in Paris, France, on spatial transmission models to describe the invasion of infectious diseases at different scales.

My main areas of interests are human mobility, pandemic preparedness, health care accessibility and inequalities.
