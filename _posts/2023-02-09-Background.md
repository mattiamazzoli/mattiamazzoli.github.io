I obtained my Master Degree in Physics of Complex Systems in 2017 at Università degli Studi di Torino, Italy.

In July 2021 I obtained my PhD title in Human Mobility and Physics of Complex Systems at IFISC (Instituto de Física Interdisciplinar y Sistemas Complejos), UIB-CSIC, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.

From 2021 and 2023 I have worked at EPIcx Lab (INSERM-Sorbonne Université), Paris, France, on spatial transmission models with different sources of mobility data.
