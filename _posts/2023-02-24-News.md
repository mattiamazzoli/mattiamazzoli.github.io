**Workshop on Spatial and Mobility data for modeling Outbreaks**

I had the pleasure of presenting my work in a public lecture and leading two tutorials sessions on the use of spatial and mobility data for epidemic modeling at the Mahidol University in Bangkok, Thailand with my colleagues at ISI Foundation.  

[Here](https://www.isi.it/events/2025-06-modeling-infectious-disease-outbreaks-using-genomic-data-workshop/) is more info on the topics we covered during this fantastic experience.
