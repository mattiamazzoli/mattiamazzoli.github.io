I was born in Urbino(PU), Italy, in 1989.
I got my Bachelor Degree in Physics (Laurea Triennale in Fisica) in 2014 and my Master Degree in Physics of Complex Systems (Laurea Magistrale in Fisica dei Sistemi Complessi) in 2017 at Università degli Studi di Torino, Italy.

In July 2021 I obtained my PhD title in Human Mobility and Physics of Complex Systems at IFISC (Instituto de Física Interdisciplinar y Sistemas Complejos), UIB-CSIC, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.

I’m interested in complex social systems, human mobility, urban systems, economics, game theory, online social networks and information diffusion.
